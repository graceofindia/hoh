  <p>The famous Chanderi fabric is a hand-woven combination of silk and cotton. The town of Chanderi, where the craft originated, is still home to master weavers who practice the age-old tradition of creating the cloth on handlooms. Chanderi saris, woven in subtle, pleasant colours, with a rich gold border, are the most popular. The traditional bootis, or motifs, of the saris include lotuses and peacocks. It is said that when this incomparable cloth was first woven, the only colour used was an extraction from the much-prized saffron herb. The delicacy of the weave and the ratio of silk to cotton are the factors that decide the worth of the sari. Nowadays, you can also find scarves, salwar kameez and mens’ jackets made with Chanderi cloth.</p>

  <p>Maheshwari is also a fabric, somewhat similar to Chanderi. It is said to have originated from Maheshwar, a city approximately 90 km from Indore. The fabric was created by weavers, who were brought from Surat by Maharani Ahilya Bai Holkar (1725-1795) to weave cloth for the royal household. The queen, particularly partial to floral designs, and thus the weavers, commanded to only create geometrical motifs, drew inspiration from the detailing of the Maheshwar Fort.</p>

  <p>Although block prints are largely associated with Rajasthan, the residents of Madhya Pradesh much prefer their own bagh prints. This bold, vibrant hand-block printing originates from Bagh village in the district of Dhar. While there are several imitations of the original print now, the real stuff is still made with organic dyes - and you can tell which is authentic by the cloth’s distinctive smell.</p>
