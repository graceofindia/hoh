  <p>The tradition of wall paintings has been passed down from pre-historic times to today. As society moved from forest dwellings to agricultural-based communities, the art of painting continued as a part of their life, tradition, culture and to transmit their traditional beliefs through their art. Wall painting forms part of the universal culture of most agricultural societies and forest dwelling societies. Paintings are done on walls to invoke the gods to bless the soil, keep animals healthy for work in the field, grant a family healthy progeny after marriage, and bless a newly constructed home. Paintings found on the walls of religious buildings depict a human quest to understand a larger universe, natural life and power.</p>

  <p>The Pithora paintings are done by the Rathwa, Bhil, Nayak and Tadi tribes of Gujarat, parts of Rajasthan and Madhya Pradesh. The origin of these paintings goes back a few thousand years, arising from the cave paintings at a local hilltop near koraj-i-dungar. These paintings speak of the social, cultural and mythological life and beliefs of the tribals.</p>
