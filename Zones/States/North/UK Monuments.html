        <h1>Bastar Place</h1>
        <p>Bastar Palace is an archaic palace which was constructed when the Kings of Bastar moved their capital to Jagdalpur. The palace has intriguing wall cravings on the walls that adds to its beauty. It is in every sense an architectural marvel that speaks boldly of the bravery of the rulers who ruled there. There is a monument built inside the grounds of the palace. It was made by the government and puts forth portraits and artefacts of the rulers from the past. When here, you must definitely take a ride on the horse carriage. </p>
