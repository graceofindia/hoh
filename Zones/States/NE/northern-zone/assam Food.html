                    <p>
                        This dish is also non-vegetation and is perfect to have during summers. The term 'Tenga' means sour and the reason for the sourness is because tomatoes, dried mangosteen, lemon, raw mango, and elephant-apple are added into it. The dish isn't that spiced but fenugreek, 5 mixed spices (panch phoran), and mustard seeds are added to add some flavour. It has a subtle sense of taste, sour fish curry which is best to have during lunch or dinner. It also helps in enhancing digestion.
