        <h1>Rang Ghar</h1>
        <p>Rang Ghar is often regarded as the ‘Colosseum of the East’. Being one of the oldest surviving amphitheaters in Asia, Rang Ghar is one of the best Sivasagar historical sites in Assam. Rang Ghar meaning the ‘House of Entertainment’ was originally a two-storied building. It was used as a royal sports pavilion, especially during the Rongali Bihu Festival.
          This historical place in Assam dates back to 1746 AD when Ahom’s used to rule the state. Thus, this edifice is of much historical importance and reflects the architectural precision and grandeur of the past

        <h1> . Hajo Powa Mecca
        </h1>
        <p>required.
          Hajo Powa Mecca has many legends associated with it. As per one of them, it is believed that the fountain of this Mecca was laid from the soil brought from the holy Mecca. And thus, it is one of the most religious historical places in Assam.
          Hajo Powa Mecca means one-quarter of Mecca and that is why people believe that visiting here will bless them with one-fourth of the god’s grace that they would otherwise get in Mecca. This mosque in Assam was constructed in 1657 by Mir Lutufullah-i-Shiraji under the rule of Shah Jahan. It is also home to the tomb of a famous pioneer of Islam, Pir Giasuddin Auliya.</p>

        <p>Also called Kareng Ghar, this monument is a testament to Assamese culture. And the fact that it is the largest building among all Ahom monuments in the world, makes it worth a visit.

The two tunnels and three underground floors in this building served as emergency evacuation for the King and the army in times of crisis.
