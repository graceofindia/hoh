        <h1>. Sukapha Samannay Kshetra</h1>
        <p>Sukapha Samannay Kshetra is built in the honor of the first Ahom king of Assam, Sukapha or Siu-Ka-Pha. He was the founder of the Ahom dynasty, which continued for nearly 600 years. Located in Mohbandha near Jorhat and Derain, it is one of the best historical places in Assam you can visit.
          Sukapha was a Thai prince who came here crossing the Patkai range. He was the chief person who started uniting the tribal and non-tribal people of the area. Thus, Sukapha Samannay Kshetra was an honor and preserved the remarkable leadership of King Sukapha. Today, excavation has been running here to find any other remains of Sukapha and the Ahom dynasty.

        <h1>Satras</h1>
        <p>Satras in Assam are institutional centers located on one of the largest inhabited river islands in the world, Majuli. They have been associated with the Ekasarana tradition of Vaishnavism and date back to the 16th century. Satras are large prayer halls facing a shrine and are encompassed by bathing tanks and dormitories for monks. They are one of the best historical places in Assam you can visit to understand Assamese culture.
          The Institution of Satra was founded by the father of Assamese culture, Sankardeva. And for clarification, they are not just monasteries but places of traditional performing arts. The first Satra was founded in the 15th century in Majuli.
          After that, 65 Satras came up. At present, there are only 22 Satras in Majuli while others were shifted due to flood and erosion. Auni-ati, Kamalabari, Dakhinpat, Garamur, Samaguri, Bengena-ati and Natun Kamalabari are some of the famous Satras of Assam.</p>
